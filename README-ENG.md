# Smart Monthly Budget – Personal Financial Advisor (Python)

A super useful and well-designed algorithm that helps you organize your personal finances every month!

### What this program does

It asks you for:

* Your monthly salary
* Whether you live in your own house or a rented one
* Your expenses: rent (if applicable), utilities, food/leisure, and how much you want to save

Then it tells you:

* Your total spending (expenses)
* How much you really have left to save
* Smart, personalized advice:

  * If you spend too much on movies/food → it tells you with a touch of humor
  * If you don’t reach your savings goal → it gives real tips to adjust your spending
